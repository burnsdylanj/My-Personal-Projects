The idea here is to build a web scraper that mass collects information from footballdb.com

Once it has collected a player's information from the website > save that information to a .json file

Then create a quiz using Python and PyQt5 to display the information

Example would be:

QB
Drafted in 2005 by the Green Bay Packers
4 Time MVP
1 Super Bowl 

Each line would be displayed one at a time and there should be a button to ask for additional hints. 
The first line displayed should always be the position/year and team the player was drafted.

QB
2005 by the Packers
